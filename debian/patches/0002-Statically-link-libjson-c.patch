Subject: Statically link libjson-c

Newer Debian releases provide libjson-c.so.3 with the libjson-c3 package,
while older Debian releases provide libjson-c.so.2 with the libjson-c2 package.
So in order to keep this package compatible with a wide range of Debian releases,
we link libjson-c statically.
